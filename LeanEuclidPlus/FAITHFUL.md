# Making proofs faithful — human operator guide

**Goal:** make each Book-2 prop FAITHFUL — every Euclid sentence ↔ one checkable Lean step — and be
**mechanically certain** it's correct. Run everything from `LeanEuclidPlus/`; launch Claude from the
repo root `DNA/`. Each prop is a folder: `Book2/PropNN/Main.lean` (the proposition + its
`euclid_sentence`s) and `Book2/PropNN/stepN.lean` (one backing file per sentence, plus any
sub-files a hard step decomposes into).

**Why you can trust it (no LLM-trust for correctness).** Everything reduces to ONE operation on a
**node** (a named `:= by sorry` body — a sentence step or a `have`): *swap its sorry for its
`euclid_apply (helper… (by assumption)…); (try split_ands) <;> assumption`, build, revert.* The helper
is FULLY applied — objects, then one `(by assumption)` per hypothesis, and the goal is closed
structurally (NOT `euclid_finish`) — so the wire does ZERO SMT: each hyp is a <1s core-Lean type-match
against the call-site context. If that builds, the node's hypotheses are all present (**suppliable**, SP).
A **leaf** backing file (no sub-`have`s) is **provable** (P) iff it builds in isolation zero-sorry; a
**container** (has sub-`have`s) is NOT re-built to prove it — instead its trailing tactics (the
`linarith [...]`/`euclid_finish` after the `have`s) are checked by building the container with sorries
tolerated (the SF-side build — SP does NOT run them; it stubs them to `sorry`), and its leaves by their
P. The `--all` audit = {SP every node} + {container build every container} + {P every leaf} +
{no stray sorry} ⟹ the final wired build **cannot fail** (every SMT query in it lives in a leaf body or
a container's trailing tactics, each already measured ≤30s; the wires themselves are SMT-free) — Lean is
the judge, not the model. The ONLY human judgement is gate A: does each claim type match the English.

---

## ONE TIME (before any prop)
Snapshot the trusted statements so any later change to a `theorem proposition_*` is caught:
```
python3 scripts/check_signatures.py --save
```
**Also build ALL dependencies once, so every cited olean is WARM:**
```
scripts/safe_build.sh Book Book2
```
This matters for speed AND robustness: with deps warm, a per-node `check_step` build compiles only
the target itself (≤30s), so the 30s wall never has to eat a cold dependency compile. It also makes
the interrupt self-heal exact — if a `check_step` build is wall-killed or Ctrl-C'd, `check_step` now
auto-purges THAT target's stale artifact (so its next build recompiles clean) without touching the
warm deps. The only case needing a manual `lake clean`/delete is the rare one where a *dependency*
itself was mid-compile at the kill — which warm deps prevent.

## PER PROP (e.g. Prop04) — three phases, two human gates (▶)

**1. Phase A — the sentence map (split → map), INTERACTIVE:**

   Run these two skills BY HAND, reviewing between them. Headless mapping stalled; interactive,
   one-sentence-at-a-time is the proven approach.

   **Stage 1 — Split (text-only):**  `/faithful-split Book2/Prop04`
   Agent reads ONLY `Book2/data/texts_proofs/4.txt` (Book 1: `Book/texts_proofs/N.txt`). Splits the
   English into atomic assertions, marks roles (intro/construction/deduction/conclusion), and identifies
   justification substrings. Outputs `Book2/Prop04/split.json`, and runs the byte-exact tiling gate
   (which you can re-run):
   ```
   python3 scripts/check_faithful.py --split Book2/Prop04
   ```
   **Human reviews the split before proceeding.**

   **Stage 2 — Map (interactive):**  `/faithful-map Book2/Prop04`
   The ONE interactive mapper (absorbs the old translate + review). It:
   1. stamps a placeholder Main from `split.json` (deterministic, no LLM):
      ```
      python3 scripts/faithful_map_assemble.py Book2/Prop04 --placeholders
      ```
      → one `euclid_sentence "loc" "text" (stepN : True) := by sorry` per sentence + `-- @assumption
      ("substring", TODO)` lines. TEXT is copied from `split.json`, so tiling is correct by construction
      (you NEVER edit sentence text).
   2. FILLS each `True` → a real claim and each `TODO` → a real type, ONE sentence at a time, building
      `check_step --provable` + `check_faithful` as it goes. Adds any structural FRAME (reductio /
      `by_cases` / `wlog`) or a construction beyond the vocab (superposition → reads `Book/PropNN.lean` +
      `find.py`/`SystemE`). **Every sentence gets a REAL claim, NEVER `True` at the end, and NEVER a
      restated given (that is an `@assumption`).** Bodies stay `:= by sorry`.

   **Sanity-check Criterion 1 (concatenated sentence texts == the canonical original) AND Criterion 4
   (every `-- @assumption ("text", …)` text is a substring of its sentence) — both must PASS; the regex
   check ALSO hard-FAILS on any `euclid_sentence` whose claim is exactly `True`:**
   - regex (quick, no build):
   ```
   python3 scripts/check_faithful.py "Book1/Prop04/Main.lean"
   ```
   - olean (authoritative, book-aware):
   ```
   lake build Book2.Prop04.Main
   scripts/check_faithful.sh Book1.Prop04.Main
   ```

   (RETIRED: the old headless `faithful-translate` / `faithful-review` / `scaffold_translate.py` 3-agent
   split — `faithful-map` does Phase A interactively now.)

**▶ 2. HUMAN GATE A — review + freeze the claims (and record the @assumption map).**
   Read each claim type: does it honestly say what that Euclid sentence says? Also eyeball each
   `-- @assumption` line: is it a genuine *consumed input*, not a conjunct the step proves? (Both are
   human-checked — no machine fully verifies faithfulness; use `Book2/data/diagrams/4.png` to resolve
   labels.) When happy:
   ```
   python3 scripts/check_steps.py --save Book1/Prop04/Main.lean
   ```
   This freezes the claim TYPES **hard** and records the `@assumption` types. Under the Assumption
   Phase (next), assumptions are first-class PROVEN obligations — frozen HARD like claims: Phase B may
   NOT drop or retype one (`check_step --all` + gate-C `check_steps.py` hard-fail on `@assumption` drift).

**▶ then the Assumption Phase (mechanical; YOU run it — NO LLM — between gate A and Phase B):**
   ```
   python3 scripts/assumptions.py Book1/Prop04            # --dry-run first to preview
   ```
   For every `-- @assumption` it materializes a `have stepK_assumptionN : type := by sorry`, then
   classifies each by a **LADDER** (cheapest/most-trivial first), PERSISTING the FIRST tactic that closes it:

     1 `rfl` · 2 `assumption` · 3 `simp (config := {zetaDelta := true})` · 4 `linarith` · 5 `nlinarith` ·
     6 `euclid_finish` (30s solver cap — the only rung that runs z3) · none → **gap**.

   **valid** (a rung closed it) → `:= by <tactic>` + `-- @assumption_valid` (free — the Phase-B agent skips
   it). The winning rung (`level` 1–6) + `closed_by` are recorded in `scripts/assumption_tags.json` as a
   GRADED triviality measure (post-processable; `tag` stays valid/gap so nothing downstream changes).
   **gap** (nothing closed it) → `:= by sorry` + `-- @assumption_gap` — a real node Phase B proves; the
   `verdict` field says why (`hard` = a candidate real reasoning gap; `crash`/`error` = a tooling limit on
   the goal shape, NOT a deep gap; `sat` = the premise is FALSE → a MAP BUG to fix). You own
   `assumption_tags.json` (agent-write-denied). Do NOT re-run `check_steps --save`. (`--dry-run` reverts
   everything.)
   The non-`euclid_finish` rungs run no solver → deterministic, immune to the SMT flake and the `simp_all`
   loop; the level-3 `simp` rung closes the superposition `img`/`lineImg` map coincidences that crash bare
   `euclid_finish`. It's fail-closed: STEP A materializes + build-checks Main; if that FAILS (almost always
   a `wlog … generalizing` frame — the have shifts `Hsym`'s arity) it leaves the haves and stops → fix the
   frame by hand (**add the redundant arg to `exact Hsym …`; never delete the have**) → `assumptions.py
   <prop> --tag-only`. After classifying it re-builds the COMBINED Main; if THAT fails it stops (tags NOT
   written) and leaves it for review. A plain re-run on an already-materialized prop auto-skips STEP A (it
   re-classifies in place — never re-materializes/duplicates).

   **The sweep (no LLM).** Once every prop is mapped + gate-A `--save`'d, run the ladder over all of them in
   a plain loop — no agent needed, since it auto-closes the trivial premises:
   ```
   for p in 01 02 03 04 05 07 08 09 10; do python3 scripts/assumptions.py Book1/Prop$p; done
   ```
   `gap`s are EXPECTED (Phase B proves them) — they are NOT failures. Only these need you+LLM: a prop that
   **exits 1** (STEP-A frame break or the final-build stop) or reports a **`sat`** (false premise / map
   bug). Fix those (frame fix via `/faithful-assumptions`; map bug by re-mapping), re-run `--tag-only` on
   just them, and the assumption phase is done → Phase B.

**3. Phase B — prove (skill):**  `/faithful-prove Book2/Prop04/Main.lean`
   The agent creates each `stepN.lean` and proves it, decomposing recursively (adding `have`+backing
   files) until every build is ≤30s. **Main stays all-sorry the whole time** — the agent never wires
   it; `check_step.py` does all wiring transiently and reverts. **Dev-state files import no pipeline
   (helper/step) files** — only `SystemE` + cited propositions; the script adds/removes a helper import
   alongside its wiring (this is why per-node checks are fast and isolated). Driving order: leaves first
   (`check_step <leaf>`) → confirm each container/step with `check_step --subtree <node>` (scoped to its
   cone) → `--all` ONCE at the very end. The agent's last action is `check_step.py Book2/Prop04 --all`
   (exit 0); it never runs `--all` mid-work. No human action needed mid-phase.

**▶ 4. HUMAN GATE B — re-run the audit.**
   ```
   python3 scripts/check_step.py Book2/Prop04 --all
   ```
   All ✓ (exit 0) ⟹ wiring everything is GUARANTEED to build. (Bottom-up; a failure names the
   deepest broken node.)

**5. Phase C — wire + verify (mechanical; YOU run it, not a skill):**
   **One command does all four (stops at the first failure):**
   ```
   scripts/phase_c.sh Book1/Prop04                  # = the four steps below, in order
   ```
   (or run them by hand — note the THREE different argument shapes, the slash-vs-dot footgun:)
   ```
   python3 scripts/wire_main.py Book1/PropNN        # commits the wiring, strips 30s caps, builds once
   scripts/check_faithful.sh Book1.PropNN.Main            # text (crit.1) + deps (crit.3), book-aware
   python3 scripts/check_steps.py Book1/PropNN/Main.lean   # claims unchanged since gate A
   python3 scripts/check_signatures.py              # no proposition statement was altered
   ```
   **▶ Gate C:** `wire_main` build green + zero sorry + all three checks PASS ⟹ Prop04 is faithful.
   (If the wired build fails: the fix is in a backing file → `wire_main.py Book2/Prop04 --unwire`
   returns Main to the all-sorry Phase-B state, then back to Phase B.)

## The scripts (who runs each)
| script | purpose | who |
|---|---|---|
| `check_signatures.py` `[--save]` | guard proposition **statements** (must never change) | human, once + gate C |
| `check_steps.py [--save] <Main>` | guard approved **claim types** AND `@assumption` types (both frozen-HARD after gate A — assumption drift is now a hard fail, no drop/retype) | human, gate A + gate C |
| `assumptions.py <propdir> [--dry-run] [--tag-only]` | **Assumption Phase** (no LLM): STEP A materializes a sorry have per `@assumption` + build-checks (fail → leave haves, fix the frame, `--tag-only`); STEP B classifies each by the LADDER (1 rfl · 2 assumption · 3 simp[zetaDelta] · 4 linarith · 5 nlinarith · 6 euclid_finish@30s), persists the first that closes + records level/closed_by, tags valid/gap in `scripts/assumption_tags.json`, then re-builds the combined Main (fail → STOP for review). Plain re-run on a materialized prop = auto `--tag-only` (no duplicate) | human (real run + sweep); agent (`--dry-run`, or fixing an exit-1 prop) |
| `check_step.py <propdir> <node>` | certify ONLY that one node (SF→SP→P, stops at first fail) — does NOT check its sub-nodes | agent (Phase B) |
| `check_step.py <propdir> --subtree <node>` | certify a node's WHOLE CONE (it + every sub-node it transitively contains), bottom-up, scoped — doesn't touch other steps; confirms a container/step is done | agent (Phase B) |
| `check_step.py <propdir> --sufficient/--suppliable/--provable <node>` | run just one of SF/SP/P (diagnostics; `--provable` reports remaining-sorry file:lines) | agent (Phase B) |
| `check_step.py <propdir> --provable` (no node) | build Main tolerating sorry — the Phase-A skeleton-elaborates check (Main has no parent ⟹ no SF/SP) | agent (Phase A) |
| `check_step.py <propdir> --context <node>` | print the real hypotheses available at a node | agent (Phase B) |
| `check_step.py <propdir> --smell <node>` | SM pre-decompose sanity check: fire the bare claim at `euclid_finish` (short solver cap) — "closes" ⟹ don't decompose / "not closed" ⟹ decompose / "SAT" ⟹ claim is false. Deliberate; the no-flag path does NOT run it | agent (Phase B) |
| `check_step.py <propdir> --check` | instant, no-build integrity scan (naming law, caps, no stray imports, no stray sorry, + criterion-3 deps) | agent (Phase B) |
| `check_step.py <propdir> --dependency` (`--deps`) | instant, no-build criterion-3 check, BOTH arms: every cited `[Prop.~B.N]` satisfied by a Main construction (`… as …`) OR its sentence's helper cone. Number-only; isolate fast before `--all` (which also runs it). The book-aware authority is the human's gate-C olean check — don't game it | agent (**Phase B** — needs helpers) |
| `check_step.py <propdir> --all` | WHOLE-prop bottom-up audit (SP every node + P every LEAF + no-stray-sorry + criterion-3 deps); the FINAL gate, run ONCE; exit 0 ⟹ Phase C guaranteed. Also HARD-enforces the assumption invariants: #1 FORCE (every `@assumption` is a helper-sig binder), #3 PARITY (every one has its have), #2a/#2b (type + valid/gap tag unchanged) | agent (end of B) + human (gate B) |
| `check_step.py <propdir> --whatchanged` (`--changed`) | instant, READ-ONLY (no build, no lock): after editing a file, report the MINIMAL set of certified nodes to re-check + WHY + the exact commands. Reads the certification manifest (written by `--all`/`--subtree`/each per-node PASS) and diffs input-file hashes. Use it instead of re-running `--all` after a fix | agent + human |
| `check_step.py <propdir> --status` (`--checklist`) | instant, READ-ONLY (no build, no lock, never writes): the durable RESUME BOARD — Main's own nodes (source order), each rolled up over its cone against the manifest into done/stale/todo, plus the 3 whole-prop checks (deps/integrity/orphans) + the exact NEXT `--subtree` commands. All-✓ + 3/3 ⟹ `--all` is GUARANTEED to pass. The committed mirror `PropNN/STATUS.md` is regenerated by `--all`/`--subtree`/per-node PASS (the same writers as the manifest) | agent + human |
| `check_step.py <propdir> --drive` | auto-loop `--subtree` over every Main node `--status` would report not-`done` (todo or stale), in source order, stopping at the first failure — covers cold-start (empty manifest) and warm-resume (skips already-`done` nodes) the same way, so you don't hand-drive `--status`'s printed command list yourself | agent (Phase B) |
| `wire_main.py <propdir> [--unwire]` | commit the wiring + build once (the ONLY script that keeps Main changed) | human (Phase C) |
| `phase_c.sh <propdir> [--unwire]` | run ALL of Phase C in order (wire_main → check_faithful → check_steps → check_signatures), stop at first failure; derives the dotted-module / Main.lean arg shapes for you | human (Phase C) |
| `check_faithful.py <Main>` | instant, no-build: text (crit 1, char-for-char) + construction-aware deps (crit 3, number-only — cited construction props need `… as …` in Main; proof-internal cites DEFER to Phase B) | agent (Phase A) |
| `check_faithful.sh Book2.PropNN.Main` | authoritative faithfulness (text crit.1 + deps crit.3, BOOK-AWARE); needs a build first. Deps are TWO-ARM, mirroring `--dependency`: each cited `[Prop.~B.N]` resolves via a Main construction (`… as …`, whole-Main) OR the citing sentence's helper cone — matched by the compiler-resolved (book-authenticated) name. Pass the `.Main` submodule (where the sentences live), or `Book2` to check every prop at once | human (gate C) |
| `safe_build.sh <target>` | serialized `lake build` (parallel-safe) | **human only** (agents are hard-denied raw builds; they use `check_step`) |

`check_step.py` (all Phase-B modes) NEVER leaves a `.lean` file modified — every swap reverts
atomically (`git status` stays clean). (The audit modes do write one git-ignored bookkeeping file —
the certification manifest under `.lake/faithful-certified/<prop>.json`, read by `--whatchanged`;
it's invisible to git and to every `.lean` check.) Only `wire_main.py` (bare) commits the wiring;
`--unwire` restores it.
The agent builds ONLY through `check_step`/`wire_main` (raw `lake build`/`safe_build.sh` are
hard-denied in `.claude/settings.json`); humans run `safe_build.sh` in their own terminal.

**What you may see (shared helpers).** A `have` helper reused by several sentences shows in `--all` as
`name: SP [N call sites] + P` (suppliability checked at each parent, proof built once). If it's reused
on *different* objects per site, each call carries a `-- @args: …` comment line above it naming that
site's actuals — committed and harmless (the guards ignore comments). Nothing for you to do; it's the
agent's mechanism for generic reuse.

**Convention — `Main` is NOT a node.** Nodes are the `euclid_sentence`s *inside* Main and the `have`s;
each has a backing file, a claim, and a parent. Main is the root container — no backing file, no
parent — so it has no SF/SP, only a build. Therefore: build Main with `check_step <propdir> --provable`
(NO node); never pass `Main` as a node (SF/SP/bare with `Main` or with no node FAIL with a message
pointing here). `propdir_of` requires `Main.lean` to exist, so a prop with no Main is rejected up front.

## Running many at scale — the headless driver (`run_faithful.py`)
Only TWO phases are automatable across a batch, and the driver does exactly those two — **`assumptions`**
and **`prove`**. Everything else is MANUAL/interactive: `/faithful-split`, `/faithful-map`, the human
GATE-A review + `check_steps.py --save`, and Phase C (`wire_main.py`). `scripts/run_faithful.py` spawns
`claude -p` per prop, saves the full agent trace, and logs cost. **Run it from `LeanEuclidPlus/` in YOUR
terminal — NOT inside an agent session** (a nested `claude` spawn is hard-denied there).

The per-prop order is: (manual) split → map → `--save` → **`assumptions`** → **`prove`** → (manual) Phase C.

1. **assumptions** — the Assumption Phase (after each prop's map is `--save`'d). **Prefer the plain no-LLM
   sweep first** — the ladder auto-closes the trivial premises, so most props need no agent:
   ```
   for p in Book1/Prop18 Book1/Prop19 …; do python3 scripts/assumptions.py $p; done
   ```
   Then spawn the LLM ONLY on the props that exited 1 (a `wlog`/`Hsym` frame break or the final-build stop)
   or reported `sat`:
   ```
   python3 scripts/run_faithful.py assumptions <the-exit-1-props> --concurrency 30
   ```
   Each spawns `/faithful-assumptions` (fixes the frame, then `--tag-only`), and a `check_step --provable`
   build-check confirms Main still elaborates. (Running the batch over ALL props still works — the agent is
   just idle overhead on the ones the sweep already handled.)
2. **prove** — the resumable prove loop, across the whole batch:
   ```
   python3 scripts/run_faithful.py prove Book1/Prop18 Book1/Prop19 … --concurrency 30
   ```
   Per prop it loops FRESH `claude` sessions (each continues from the on-disk step files + manifest, not
   a `--resume`) until `check_step <propdir> --all` exits 0, writing one checkpoint per session. A Book-1
   prop gets its original `Book/PropNN.lean` offered as a math reference. Then run Phase C (`phase_c.sh`)
   per certified prop.

**Monitor live** from another terminal: `python3 scripts/monitor_tui.py` (auto-discovers the running
batch; no-lag even at 30+ props — status is computed off-thread, the render only reads a cache).

**Cost + trace** land under each `PropNN/`:
- `runs/<phase>-<seq>-<sid>.jsonl` — full streamed agent trace (**git-ignored**).
- `cost/assumptions.json` · `cost/prove/<seq>.json` (status snapshot + cumulative $) ·
  `cost/summary.json` (per-phase + overall).
  **Committed.** Checkpoint delta = `cumulative_usd` now − prev.

`--dry-run` prints the plan and spawns nothing. `--model M` overrides the model; `--max-resumes K` caps
prove resumes. Concurrency 30 is fine (funded); builds serialize on the `.lake` flock (thinking
parallelizes, building doesn't) — if prove wall-time drags, give each prop its own git worktree.
**The human gates are irreducible** (faithfulness is human-judged; `--save` is human-only; Phase C is
mechanical-human) — a batch is unattended WITHIN each segment, gated between. **Calibrate on ONE prop
first** to get a real per-prop $ before scaling to 10, then 30.

## Book 1 at scale
Book-1 faithful work lands in the folderized `Book1/PropNN/` tree (parallel to the flat, untouched
`Book/PropNN.lean` originals); `Book1/Prop06` is the vetted pilot. Phase C for a Book-1 prop adds
`import Book1.PropNN.Main` to `Book1.lean` (mirror of `Book2.lean`) — stage it alongside. Dev-state
per-prop builds need NO aggregator/lakefile change (a new `Book1/PropNN/` builds under the existing
`Book1/` source path, as Prop06 does).

## If a gate fails — what it means / where to fix
- **Gate A** never "fails" — it's your judgement. If a claim is wrong, fix it in `Main.lean` and
  re-`--save`.
- **`--check` fails** → a structural problem (a node with no backing file, a name that breaks the
  naming law `node ≡ file ≡ helper_<book>_<prop>_node`, a missing 30s cap, a pre-wired node). Fix the file.
- **`--all` SP-fail** → a hypothesis the node declares isn't present at its call site, so its
  `(by assumption)` failed (`tactic 'assumption' failed`) — the wire is SMT-free, so this is NOT a
  timeout, it's a signature mismatch. Fix that backing file's signature: drop the hyp and derive it
  in-body (`euclid_assert` before use), or match its form to the literal atom the context has (take the
  atoms of a packaged abbrev, fix an orientation). **Never raise a cap** (caps are irrelevant here).
  (If the *combine* above the node times out instead, that's a P/combine cost — decompose it.)
- **`--all` P-fail** → a LEAF backing file doesn't build zero-sorry (still has a `sorry`, or a 30s
  timeout → decompose into more `have`+backing files). Containers aren't P-built.
- **`--check` stray-sorry** → a `sorry`/`admit`/`axiom` that isn't a declared node body (e.g. a faked
  combine). Replace with real tactics (`euclid_finish`), or make it a proper `have`+backing node.
- **Gate C build fails** → a step left unproven slipped through; `wire_main --unwire` and return to
  Phase B. `check_faithful.sh`/`check_steps.py`/`check_signatures.py` fail → a text/dep/claim/statement
  drifted; the message says which.

## After editing a file mid-proof — `--whatchanged` (don't re-run `--all` to find out)
Once you've run an audit (`--all`, or any `--subtree`/per-node check), a **certification manifest**
records which nodes are proven and the hashes of each node's *input files*. When you then edit a file
to fix something, run:
```
python3 scripts/check_step.py Book2/Prop04 --whatchanged
```
It diffs the hashes and prints the **minimal, exact** set of nodes to re-check — never a guess, never
the whole prop:
```
CHANGED FILES:  • Book2/Prop04/step24.lean (modified)
MUST RE-CHECK (1 node):  ✗ step24_hf — it is wired in step24.lean, which modified → re-run SP
Still certified (unaffected): 46 node(s).
RE-CHECK COMMANDS:  python3 scripts/check_step.py Book2/Prop04 step24_hf
```
**Why this is the whole story (sound + minimal):** the SF/SP/P checks are mutually isolated, so a
node's certificate depends ONLY on its own input files — its backing file + the container(s) it's wired
in. Editing file X therefore invalidates exactly `{the node backed by X} ∪ {the nodes wired inside X}`
and nothing else — there is **no transitive cascade** (a grandparent builds against the parent's
signature in `parent.lean`, which you didn't touch). So a node NOT listed is still genuinely certified.
Re-running `check_step <node>` on each listed node re-stamps its hashes (clearing it from
`--whatchanged`); once all pass, run `--all` ONCE as the final witness. `--whatchanged` itself is
read-only — no build, no lock, never edits anything.

## Resuming work — `--status` (the durable checklist)
Phase B on a real prop spans many sessions/agents. `--status` is the board you check FIRST when
picking a prop back up — it answers "what's left" without re-deriving it from memory or re-running
`--all`:
```
python3 scripts/check_step.py Book2/Prop04 --status
```
It walks **Main's own nodes, in true source order** (every `euclid_sentence` and every top-level
`have` literally in `Main.lean` — not their sub-nodes), and rolls each one's whole cone up against
the certification manifest into exactly one of:
```
✓ step7   done   cone certified, inputs fresh
⚠ step12  stale  Book2/Prop04/step12.lean changed since audit (re-run: --subtree step12)
○ step20  todo   cone has uncertified node(s): step20_hbc, step20_par
```
plus the 3 whole-prop checks (criterion-3 deps / integrity / orphans) and a `SUMMARY` line with the
exact next `--subtree`/`--all` command. **Drive Main's nodes in this order, top to bottom** — once a
node shows `✓`, it's done; never revisit an earlier `✓` node except by editing inside its own cone
(which immediately flips it back to `⚠` via the hash check, so you can't silently regress it).
**All-✓ + all 3 checks green ⟺ `--all` is guaranteed to pass** — `--status` IS `--all`'s outcome,
computed read-only from the manifest instead of re-running the audit.

`--status` is read-only (no build, no lock, never writes anything) — safe to run any time, including
mid-build by another process. To actually CLOSE what `--status` lists instead of running each printed
`--subtree` command by hand, run `--drive`: it takes the same rollup, runs `--subtree` on the first
not-`done` node, stops at the first real failure (fix it, then re-run `--drive` to resume), and
otherwise keeps going until every Main node is `✓`. It works the same way on a prop with NO manifest
yet (every node starts `todo`, so it just drives node 1, 2, 3, … in order) as it does resuming a
partially-certified prop (it skips the already-`done` nodes).

The **committed mirror** `PropNN/STATUS.md` is a plain rendering of the
same rows, regenerated automatically by whatever already writes the manifest (`--all`, `--subtree`,
each per-node PASS) — so it's always at most one audit stale, is reviewable in a diff/PR, and (like
`agent_notes.md` below) is invisible to every `.lean` scanner. **Never hand-edit `STATUS.md`** — it's
overwritten on the next audit; if it looks wrong, the manifest or the rows are wrong, not the file.

**Freeform notes alongside the checklist.** Two `.md` scratchpads (never parsed back, never enforced,
just for agents/humans to leave breadcrumbs):
- `AGENT_NOTES.md` (repo root) — cross-cutting findings: tooling quirks, token-savers, ideas that
  span props.
- `Book<N>/PropNN/agent_notes.md` (per-prop, created on demand) — findings scoped to that one prop:
  why a node was decomposed a certain way, a dead end you tried, context the next agent on this prop
  should have. Check it when resuming a prop, alongside `--status`.
