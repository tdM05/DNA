/- 2.7.11: DG (= the bottom-left square DHGN) is the square on AC — area(DHGN) = |a─c|².
   DHGN is a rectangle (step11_parDG) with the right angle ∠h:d:n = ∟ (= ∠a:d:e), so by
   rectangle_area its area is |h─d|·|h─g| (step11_rect). Its sides equal AC: |h─d| = |a─c|
   (step11_dhac, since |a─h| = |b─f| = |b─c| and |a─d| = |a─b| = |a─c|+|c─b|) and |a─c| = |h─g|
   (step11_hgac, opposite sides of rectangle ACGH). Hence area = |a─c|·|a─c|. -/
