/- BF = BC (shared core of sentence 2.7.9, also used by 2.7.8). In the square CF (= CBFG) the side
   BF equals the opposite side CG (step9_cgbf, via Prop.~1.34), and CG = CB by the isosceles argument
   on triangle CGB (step9_corr/iso/cgb/bccg: the base angles ∠cgb and ∠gbc are equal, so
   |b─c| = |c─g|). Hence |b─f| = |c─g| = |b─c|. -/
