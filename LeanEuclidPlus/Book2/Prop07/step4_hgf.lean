/- 2.7.4 sub: g (= CN ∩ HF) is between h and f on HF. The vertical line CN separates h from f:
   a, b are on opposite sides of CN (c ∈ CN is between a and b on AB, pasch_3); a and h are on the
   same side of CN (both on AD ∥ CN, step3_ahcf); f and b are on the same side of CN (both on
   BE ∥ CN, step4_fsb); hence h and f are on opposite sides of CN, and the crossing point g of HF
   with CN lies between them (pasch_4). -/
