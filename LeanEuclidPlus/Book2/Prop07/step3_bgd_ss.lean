/- 2.7.3 sub-sub: a and d are on the same side of CN. Both lie on AD, which does not cross CN.
   c distinguishes the lines: c ∈ CN, but c ∉ AD (step3_cnad), so CN ≠ AD; then a, d are off CN
   (a shared point of two distinct lines makes them intersect); finally a, d off CN on a line
   parallel to CN lie on the same side. -/
