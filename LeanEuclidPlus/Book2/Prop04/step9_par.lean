/- 2.4.9/2.4.10 shared: CGKB is a parallelogram, formParallelogram c b g k AB HK CF BE. Sides: c,b on
   the base AB; g,k on HK (∥ AB); c,g on the vertical CF; b,k on the right side BE. From the root
   off-line facts c ∉ AD (c is the interior cut, off the left side) and a ∉ BE (a is off the right
   side), the line distinctness AD≠CF, CF≠BE, BE≠AD follow; then CF ∥ BE (step9_cfbe via Prop.~1.30),
   c.sameSide g BE (step9_csg) and b ≠ k (step9_bk) complete the parallelogram. -/
