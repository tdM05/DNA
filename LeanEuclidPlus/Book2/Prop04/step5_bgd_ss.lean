/- 2.4.5 sub-sub: a and d are on the same side of CF. Both lie on AD, which does not cross CF.
   c distinguishes the lines: c ∈ CF, but c ∉ AD — c is strictly between a and b on AB (so c ≠ a),
   and AD meets AB only at a (∠ b:a:d = ∟ ⟹ AD ≠ AB), so c ∉ AD. Hence CF ≠ AD; then a, d are off
   CF (a shared point of two distinct lines makes them intersect); finally a, d off CF on a line
   parallel to CF lie on the same side. -/
