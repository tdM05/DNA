/- 2.4.15 sub: k (= HK ∩ BE) is between b and e on the right side BE. HK separates b from e:
   • along the diagonal BD, g (∈ HK) is between b and d (step5_bgd), so b and d are on opposite
     sides of HK (pasch_3);
   • d and e both lie on DE ∥ HK (step15_dehk via Prop.~1.30), so d and e are on the same side of HK
     (step15_dse);
   hence b and e are on opposite sides of HK, and the crossing point k of BE with HK lies between
   them (pasch_4). The off-line points b∉HK, d∉HK, g∉AB, a∉DE give the line distinctness. -/
