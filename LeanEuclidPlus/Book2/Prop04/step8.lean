/- 2.4.8: |(b─c)| = |(c─g)|. In triangle c,g,b (sides c─g on CF, g─b on BD, b─c on AB) the base
   angles at g and b are equal — ∠ c:g:b = ∠ g:b:c (step7), recast to ∠ c:g:b = ∠ c:b:g by symmetry
   — so the sides subtending them are equal: |c─g| = |c─b| [Prop.~1.6], i.e. |b─c| = |c─g|.
   The triangle's three lines are pairwise distinct (sub-nodes derive CF≠BD, BD≠AB, AB≠CF from the
   parallels HK∥AB and the perpendiculars). -/
