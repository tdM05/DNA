/- 2.4.13: "So I say that (it is) also right-angled." Announces the four right angles of CGKB. Since
   this sentence precedes 2.4.14–2.4.17 (which prove them), it re-derives the four angles here from the
   construction, reusing the same helper logic: ∠ k:b:c = ∟ (step15, square corner), the co-interior
   sum ∠ k:b:c + ∠ g:c:b = ∟+∟ (step14) ⟹ ∠ b:c:g = ∟ (step16), and the opposite angles
   ∠ c:g:k = ∟ ∧ ∠ g:k:b = ∟ (step17). -/
