/- 2.4.21: the square CGKB is on CB — area(CGKB) = |c─b|². CGKB is a parallelogram (step9_par) with
   the right angle ∠ c:g:k = ∟ (step18), so by rectangle_area its area
   (△c:g:k + △c:b:k) = |c─b|·|c─g|; and |c─g| = |c─b| (step12, equilateral), giving |c─b|·|c─b|.
   (△c:b:k = △c:k:b by area symmetry.) -/
