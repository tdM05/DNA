/- 2.5.15: LG = |CD|². The square LG (= rectangle LEGH) has area |l─e|·|l─h| (step15_rect, via
   rectangle_area on the LEGH parallelogram step15_par with the right corner step15_lhg_right), and
   both sides equal CD: |l─h| = |c─d| (step15_lh_cd, CDHL opposite sides) and |l─e| = |c─d|
   (step15_le_cd, length arithmetic using |c─l| = |d─h| = |d─b|). Hence area = |c─d|·|c─d|. -/
