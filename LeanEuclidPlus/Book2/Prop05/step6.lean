/- 2.5.6: the complements CDHL and HMFG of the square CEFB about diagonal BE are equal [Prop.~1.43].
   proposition_43 on CEFB (diagonal B-E through h), with the two parallelograms ABOUT the diagonal
   (BMDH at corner B = `b m d h`, HGLE at corner E = `h g l e`), yields
   △d:c:l + △d:l:h = △m:h:g + △m:g:f (the two complements, split along their B-E-ward diagonals).
   The parallelogram_area bridges (step6_lhs on CDHL, step6_rhs on HMFG) recast those to the goal's
   triangulation △c:d:h + △c:h:l = △h:m:f + △h:f:g. -/
