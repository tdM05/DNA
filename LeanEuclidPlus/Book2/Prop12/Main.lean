    "In obtuse-angled triangles, the square on the side subtending the obtuse angle is greater than the (sum of the) squares on the sides containing the obtuse angle by twice the (rectangle) contained by one of the sides around the obtuse angle, to which a perpendicular (straight-line) falls, and the (straight-line) cut off outside (the triangle) by the perpendicular (straight-line) towards the obtuse angle. Let $ABC$ be an obtuse-angled triangle, having the angle $BAC$ obtuse. And let $BD$ be drawn from point $B$, perpendicular to $CA$ produced [Prop.~1.12]. I say that the square on $BC$ is greater than the (sum of the) squares on $BA$ and $AC$ by twice the rectangle contained by $CA$ and $AD$."
