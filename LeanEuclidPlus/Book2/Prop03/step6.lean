/- 2.3.6: AD is the rectangle contained by AC and CB, since DC = CB. The left rectangle ACDF (top
   A-C on AB, bottom F-D on DE, verticals AF and CD). Sub-nodes: step5_edf (between e d f, shared),
   step6_sameside (a.sameSide f CD), step6_par (the parallelogram a c f d), step6_area (the
   rectangle_area area identity △a:f:d + △a:d:c = |a─c|*|a─f|), step6_haf (|a─f| = |c─d|). Then
   |c─d| = |c─b| (square edge) gives the final |a─c|*|c─b|. -/
