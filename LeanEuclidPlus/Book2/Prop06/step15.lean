/- 2.6.15: the gnomon NOP and the square LG together make up the whole square CEFD, which on CD has
   area |c─d|². The figure decomposition (gnomon + LG = △c:e:f + △c:f:d) is step15_decomp (two
   sum_parallelograms_area cuts: KM splits CEFD into the top strip and the bottom strip, then BG splits
   the bottom strip into LHGE and HMFG); the square's area (△c:e:f + △c:f:d = |c─d|²) is step15_sq
   (rectangle_area on CEFD). -/
