/- 2.6.13: LG = |c─b| · |c─b|. The square LG (= rectangle LHGE) has area |l─e|·|l─h| (step13_rect, via
   rectangle_area on the LHGE parallelogram step13_par with the right corner step13_lhg_right), and both
   sides equal CB: |l─h| = |c─b| (step13_lh_cb, CBHL opposite sides) and |l─e| = |c─b| (step13_le_cb,
   length arithmetic using |c─l| = |b─h| = |b─d|). Hence area = |c─b|·|c─b|. -/
