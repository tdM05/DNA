/- 2.6 shared worker (used by step11_dmdb and step13): |(b─d)| = |(b─h)|.
   Triangle BDH is right-isosceles: ∠ d:b:h = ∟ (BG ⊥ AB) and the base angles ∠ b:d:h = ∠ b:h:d, so
   the sides BD, BH subtending the equal base angles are equal [Prop.~1.6]. The base-angle equality is
   the diagonal chain (h between d,e on DE):
     ∠ d:h:b = ∠ c:e:d              (corr: BG ∥ CE cut by diagonal DE — step11_dmdb_corr)
     ∠ c:e:d = ∠ c:d:e              (CDE isosceles, |c─e|=|c─d| — step11_dmdb_iso)
     ∠ c:d:e = ∠ b:d:h              (ray d→c ≡ d→b, ray d→e ≡ d→h — equal_angles)
   hence ∠ b:d:h = ∠ d:h:b = ∠ b:h:d. (Mirror of Prop05 step13_dhdb.) -/
