/- sub-fact for 2.6.6 / step6_lc: h ∉ AB. h lies on the diagonal DE and on BG. e ∉ AB (reuse
   step2_eoff, the right-angle degeneracy). If h ∈ AB then h and d (both on DE, d on AB) would force
   DE = AB (unless h = d), putting e ∈ AB — contradiction; and h = d is impossible since h is on BG
   with b (b ≠ d as d is beyond b on AB), off the top line through d. -/
