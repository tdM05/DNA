/- Helper for 2.1.5: c and h (both on the right vertical CH) are on the same side of the EL
   vertical. CH ∦ EL (sub-node step5_ss_ch_el_par, via proposition_30 since both ∦ BF). c,h are
   off EL (a common point of EL and CH would force them to meet, contradicting CH ∦ EL — CH ≠ EL
   since e ≠ c sits on EL∩BC while c on CH is off EL). Being off EL and not separable across it,
   c and h share a side. -/
