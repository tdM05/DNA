/- 2.1.5: rectangle BH (= B,C,H,G) equals BK + DL + EH.
   Strategy: cut BH by the EL vertical into BELG + ELHC, then cut BELG by the DK vertical into
   BDKG + DELK; the two sum_parallelograms_area equations telescope into the goal. The hard
   preconditions (the parallelogram sameSide facts and the foot betweennesses g-l-h, g-k-l) are
   derived as sub-nodes; the shared distinctness / off-base facts they rely on are bundled into
   step5_dist and step5_offbc (anchored on the perpendicular foot f, off BC). -/
