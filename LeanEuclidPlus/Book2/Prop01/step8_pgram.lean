/- Helper for 2.1.8: d,k,e,l form a parallelogram with sides DK (d,k), EL (e,l), rail BC (d,e)
   and rail GH (k,l). DK ∦ EL (sub-node step8_pgram_par, via proposition_30 since both ∦ BF).
   The sameSide d e GH (both on BC ∥ GH) and k ≠ l come from step8_pgram_ss; the parallelogram
   is then assembled directly (the BC ∦ GH conjunct is an orientation flip of the given). -/
