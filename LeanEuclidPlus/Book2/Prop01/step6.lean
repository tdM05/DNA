/- 2.1.6: rectangle BH (= B,C,H,G) is the rectangle contained by A and BC.
   BH is contained by GB and BC (rectangle_area on the parallelogram b,g,c,h with the right angle
   ∠b:c:h = ∟), giving area = |b─g| * |b─c|; and |b─g| = |a₁a₂| (step2), so area = |a₁a₂| * |b─c|.
   The right angle at c (step6_rangle) and the parallelogram (step6_pgram) are derived as sub-nodes. -/
