    "If some straight-line touches a circle, and some (other) straight-line is drawn across, from the point of contact into the circle, cutting the circle (in two), (then) those angles the (straight-line) makes with the tangent will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle. For let some straight-line $EF$ touch the circle $ABCD$ at the point $B$, and let some (other) straight-line $BD$ be drawn from point $B$ into the circle $ABCD$, cutting it (in two). I say that the angles $BD$ makes with the tangent $EF$ will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle. That is to say, that angle $FBD$ is equal to the angle constructed in segment $BAD$, and angle $EBD$ is equal to the angle constructed in segment $DCB$."

  -- Euclid's point $A$ plays two roles that coincide in his single figure: (i) the endpoint of the
  -- perpendicular from $B$ (the antipode of $B$), and (ii) a point of segment $BAD$. Our theorem's `a`
  -- is the GENERIC point of segment $BAD$ (role ii); Euclid's perpendicular endpoint (role i) is the
  -- distinct point `a'`. Steps 3.32.1–3.32.10 are Euclid's argument about `a'`; step 3.32.11
  -- (`in the alternate segment`) carries the result to the generic `a` via [Prop.~3.21].
