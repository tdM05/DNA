-- Faithful to Euclid's DEMONSTRATION (not the enunciation's "always"): he names the three other lines
-- FB, FC, FG and proves the specific chain FA>FB>FC>FG>FD (greatest/least = the ends of the chain), under
-- the figure ordering ∠BEF>∠CEF>∠GEF; plus the two-equal (a mirror H on the far side of AD, and uniqueness).
-- Modeled on the faithful sibling Book3/Prop08. (The earlier ∀-over-all-points version over-generalized
-- beyond what the proof actually demonstrates — corrected 2026-07-06.)

And for the others, a (straight-line) nearer$^\\dag$ to the (straight-line) through the center is always greater than a (straight-line) further away. And only two equal (straight-lines) will radiate from the point towards the (circumference of the) circle, (one) on each (side) of the least (straight-line).
