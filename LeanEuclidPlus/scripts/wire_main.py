"""PHASE C committer for the faithful pipeline — the ONLY script that modifies real files for keeps.

Run by the HUMAN, after Phase B's gate (`check_step.py <propdir> --all` passes). That audit has already
PROVEN that wiring every node would build, so this is a mechanical witness, not a search.

USAGE  (run from LeanEuclidPlus/):
  python3 scripts/wire_main.py <propdir>            COMMIT the wiring + build Main once (uncapped)
  python3 scripts/wire_main.py <propdir> --unwire   reverse it: every node back to `:= by sorry`,
                                                      30s caps restored (return to a Phase-B state)

  <propdir> is e.g. Book2/Prop04 (or Book2/Prop04/Main.lean).

WIRE (bare): for EVERY node in EVERY file of the prop, replace `:= by sorry` with the canonical
  `euclid_apply (helper_<book>_<name> <objs>); euclid_finish`, and DELETE every
  `set_option systemE.solverTime 30 in` line (→ System E's 300s default — strictly more time than the
  30s dev cap, never less; the final build is provably correct so it needs no tight cap and no wall
  timeout). Then build `<propdir>.Main` ONCE, uncapped, under the build lock. Guaranteed green if
  `--all` passed; a `declaration uses 'sorry'` warning means a node was left unproven → its fix is in a
  backing file → `--unwire` and go back to Phase B.

This is a SEPARATE script from check_step.py (which always reverts) precisely so "verify, reverting"
and "commit the wiring" can never be confused. Both share the swap/cap logic in faithful_lib.py.
