"""Shared library for the faithful pipeline (Phase B verify + Phase C wire). NO CLI — imported by
`check_step.py` and `wire_main.py`.

THE MODEL (see the plan / the faithful-prove skill). Everything is ONE recursive atom:
  * CONTAINER  = any .lean file with a tactic proof holding goal nodes (Main.lean, stepN.lean, a
                 sub-file, …). A container may also hold REAL euclid_apply proof work — that is not a
                 node and is never touched.
  * GOAL NODE  = a named `:= by sorry` body. Two surface forms, identical at the proof level:
                   - Main only:  euclid_sentence "loc" "txt" (stepN : C) := by sorry
                   - anywhere :  have <name> : C := by sorry
  * BACKING FILE = the helper proving a node.  NAMING LAW (enforced, abort-loud):
                   node name  ≡  <name>.lean basename  ≡  theorem helper_<book>_<name>.
  * WIRING     = a node's `sorry` replaced by the canonical
                   euclid_apply (helper_<book>_<name> <objs>); euclid_finish
                 where <objs> = the Point/Line/Circle binder names of the backing theorem, in order.
                 ONLY scripts ever write wiring; the agent only writes proof bodies + adds sorry-`have`s.

Bodies on disk are ALWAYS one canonical single-line shape (the only shapes this lib reads/writes):
    := by sorry
    := by trace_state; sorry                              (transient, --context only)
    := by euclid_apply (helper_<book>_<name> …); euclid_finish
A fixed-shape text swap on these (no tactic parsing) ⟹ false positives are structurally impossible.

Caps: every file carries `set_option systemE.solverTime 30 in` above its theorem in the dev state.
Phase C (`wire_main`) deletes it (→ System E's 300s default — strictly MORE time, never less).

# ── certification manifest (incremental "what's certified / what to recheck after an edit") ───────────
# A per-prop JSON sidecar recording, for each node the audit certified, the HASHES of that node's INPUT
# files (the small fixed set its checks read). Because the SF/SP/P checks are mutually isolated, a node's
# certificate stays valid iff NONE of its input files changed — and there is NO transitive cascade (a
# grandparent builds against the parent's signature in parent.lean, untouched; a grandchild against the
# child's file, untouched). So diffing input-file hashes is a COMPLETE, BOUNDED answer to "after editing
# file X, which nodes must I re-check?". The manifest is written ONLY by audits (--all/--subtree/per-node
# pass); `--whatchanged` is pure-read. It lives under `.lake/` (git-ignored; invisible to integrity_scan,
# which scans only *.lean), keyed exactly like prop_lock so it never collides across props.
