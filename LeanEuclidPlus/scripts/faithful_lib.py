"""Shared library for the faithful pipeline (Phase B verify + Phase C wire). NO CLI — imported by
`check_step.py` and `wire_main.py`.

THE MODEL (see the plan / the faithful-prove skill). Everything is ONE recursive atom:
  * CONTAINER  = any .lean file with a tactic proof holding goal nodes (Main.lean, stepN.lean, a
                 sub-file, …). A container may also hold REAL euclid_apply proof work — that is not a
                 node and is never touched.
  * GOAL NODE  = a named `:= by sorry` body. Two surface forms, identical at the proof level:
                   - Main only:  euclid_sentence "loc" "txt" (stepN : C) := by sorry
                   - anywhere :  have <name> : C := by sorry
  * BACKING FILE = the helper proving a node.  NAMING LAW (enforced, abort-loud):
                   node name  ≡  <name>.lean basename  ≡  theorem helper_<book>_<name>.
  * WIRING     = a node's `sorry` replaced by the canonical
                   euclid_apply (helper_<book>_<name> <objs>); euclid_finish
                 where <objs> = the Point/Line/Circle binder names of the backing theorem, in order.
                 ONLY scripts ever write wiring; the agent only writes proof bodies + adds sorry-`have`s.

Bodies on disk are ALWAYS one canonical single-line shape (the only shapes this lib reads/writes):
    := by sorry
    := by trace_state; sorry                              (transient, --context only)
    := by euclid_apply (helper_<book>_<name> …); euclid_finish
A fixed-shape text swap on these (no tactic parsing) ⟹ false positives are structurally impossible.

Caps: every file carries `set_option systemE.solverTime 30 in` above its theorem in the dev state.
Phase C (`wire_main`) deletes it (→ System E's 300s default — strictly MORE time, never less).

    positionally (`objs`) and one typed slot per hypothesis binder. Full application makes the
    `euclid_apply` term carry no remaining antecedent arrow, so it takes the no-SMT `obtain` branch
    (SystemE/Meta/Tactics/Solve.lean). A hypothesis not present in context makes its slot fail loudly.
    The goal is closed DIRECTLY by `euclid_apply` itself (close-directly-first branch, zero SMT).

    Slot format — ONE fixed, bracket-delimited shape for EVERY hypothesis slot:
        (by euclid_assumption "TEXT" (show T; PROOF))
      - structural (no annotation) → TEXT = ""              , PROOF = assumption
      - reasoning  (annotated)     → TEXT = the citation text, PROOF = assumption
      - reasoning + override       → TEXT = the citation text, PROOF = exact <pf>

    100%-ROBUSTNESS comes from exactly two properties, both fully controlled here:
      1. BRACKETS bound the proof — `(show T; PROOF)` is one balanced `(...)`, so the recognizer
         (a balanced-paren scan, NOT a regex) finds its end unambiguously at ANY nesting depth, and
         Lean parses it as a single parenthesized tactic. The fixed `euclid_assumption "…" (…)` head
         is identical for every slot.
      2. SINGLE-LINE type — `T` is `_norm`-collapsed to one line before embedding. The one and only
         generation failure ever seen was a multi-line binder type whose continuation fell below Lean's
         `colGt` and got truncated at `=`; with no newline in `T` that cannot happen. (`resolve_call_args`
         has already remapped `T` into the call site's `@args` object names, so `show T` matches the goal.)
    `TEXT` is `"`-free by construction (the `-- @assumption` regex forbids `"` inside it), so the string
    literal can't break either. The annotated slot is identified by matching `_norm(T)` against the
    `@assumption` annotation's (also normalized) type."""

# ── certification manifest (incremental "what's certified / what to recheck after an edit") ───────────
# A per-prop JSON sidecar recording, for each node the audit certified, the HASHES of that node's INPUT
# files (the small fixed set its checks read). Because the SF/SP/P checks are mutually isolated, a node's
# certificate stays valid iff NONE of its input files changed — and there is NO transitive cascade (a
# grandparent builds against the parent's signature in parent.lean, untouched; a grandchild against the
# child's file, untouched). So diffing input-file hashes is a COMPLETE, BOUNDED answer to "after editing
# file X, which nodes must I re-check?". The manifest is written ONLY by audits (--all/--subtree/per-node
# pass); `--whatchanged` is pure-read. It lives under `.lake/` (git-ignored; invisible to integrity_scan,
# which scans only *.lean), keyed exactly like prop_lock so it never collides across props.
