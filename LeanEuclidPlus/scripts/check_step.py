"""PHASE B verifier for the faithful pipeline. The agent's ONLY build tool in Phase B (raw
`lake`/`safe_build` are hard-denied to the agent; this owns every build, always wall-capped).

It NEVER leaves a file modified — every swap is reverted (atomic, even on Ctrl-C). The agent uses it
to run the recursive SF/SP/P recipe (see the faithful-prove skill); the human re-runs `--all` as gate B.

  <propdir> is e.g. Book2/Prop04  (or Book2/Prop04/Main.lean).

THE CHECKS (node X, parent container Cnt, backing file X.lean):
  SF — SUFFICIENT : build Cnt with X's body `:= by sorry` (no wiring, no import; backing file need not
      exist). Green ⟹ X's CLAIM is well-typed in Cnt and closes its goal. Cheapest; uses ONLY the claim.
  SP — SUPPLIABLE (ISOLATED, O(1), no SMT) : wire ONLY X in Cnt (`euclid_apply (helper X-objs
      (by assumption)…); (try split_ands) <;> assumption`); ALL other nodes + the combine tail stay
      `sorry`; X.lean warmed SIGNATURE-ONLY. Green ⟹ Cnt supplies X's hypotheses — each `(by assumption)`
      is an exact TYPE-match against the context (so a hyp must match the EXACT shape the context has;
      `(by assumption)` does NOT crack a conjunction). Body- and combine-independent. (--context AIDS.)
  COMBINE — (CONTAINERS ONLY) : build Cnt's backing file in dev state (sub-nodes sorry, REAL combine
      tail), tolerate sorry. Green ⟹ the combine closes from the sub-node claim-types.
  P  — PROVABLE   : LEAVES ONLY — build X.lean isolated → ZERO sorry. A CONTAINER backing file is NOT
      P-built ('container' = n/a): its combine is certified by its OWN combine-check, its leaves by P.
  The no-flag command `check_step <node>` certifies ONLY that node (SF/SP, + P if leaf / Combine if
  container) — NOT its sub-nodes. To confirm a CONTAINER/step's whole subtree, use `--subtree <node>`
  (SP every in-cone call site + Combine every in-cone container + P every leaf, bottom-up). `--all` does
  this for the WHOLE prop + a no-stray-sorry scan. All green in `--all` ⟹ the Phase-C wired build cannot
  fail and is sorry-free: every SMT query in that build is one already measured ≤30s by a leaf-P or a
  combine-check, and every wire discharges by SMT-free `assumption`.
  DRIVING ORDER: leaves first (bare `check_step`), then `--subtree` each container/step bottom-up (only
  after its components pass), then `--all` ONCE at the very end. NEVER run `--all` to find a failure.

Every build carries a 30s SMT cap (`solverTime`, the proving BUDGET) and is wrapped in a 45s WALL timeout
(a diagnostic/safety bound, deliberately > the SMT cap — see WALL in faithful_lib.py). A solver that gives
up at the 30s cap, OR a >45s wall-kill, ⟹ the node is TOO BIG → DECOMPOSE into more backing files; NEVER
raise the cap. (The 15s gap lets Lean's LOCATED "Could not prove" error surface before the wall SIGKILLs.)
