    "If two triangles have two  sides equal to two sides, respectively, and have the angle(s) enclosed by the equal straight-lines equal, then they will also have the base equal to the base, and the triangle will be equal to the triangle,  and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles. Let $ABC$ and $DEF$ be  two triangles having the two sides $AB$ and $AC$ equal to the two sides $DE$ and $DF$, respectively. (That is) $AB$ to $DE$, and $AC$ to $DF$. And (let) the angle $BAC$ (be) equal to the angle $EDF$. I say that the base $BC$ is also equal to the base $EF$, and  triangle $ABC$ will be equal to triangle $DEF$, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles. (That is) $ABC$ to $DEF$, and $ACB$ to $DFE$."
