Let  $ABC$ and $DEF$ be two triangles having the two sides $AB$ and $AC$  equal to the two sides $DE$ and $DF$, respectively. (That is), $AB$ (equal) to $DE$, and  $AC$ to $DF$.  Let them also have the angle at $A$ greater than the angle at $D$.  I say that the base $BC$ is also greater than the base $EF$. "
