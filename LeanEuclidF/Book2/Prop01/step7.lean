/- 2.1.7: rectangle BK (= B,D,K,G) is the rectangle contained by A and BD.
   BK is contained by GB and BD (rectangle_area on the parallelogram b,g,d,k with the right angle
   ∠b:d:k = ∟), giving area = |b─g| * |b─d|; and |b─g| = |a₁a₂| (step2), so area = |a₁a₂| * |b─d|.
   The right angle at d (step7_rangle) and the parallelogram (step7_pgram) are derived as sub-nodes. -/
