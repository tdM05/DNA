"""PreToolUse(Write/Edit) hook: enforce in-order step discipline for the faithful pipeline.

Agents keep writing backing files for steps beyond the current frontier (e.g. creating step12.lean
when step8 isn't certified). The skill says "don't do this" but agents ignore prose. This hook
hard-denies the file creation so the agent physically cannot skip ahead.

RULE: a file matching `Book*/Prop*/step<N>*.lean` is allowed only if step<N>'s Main-level ancestor
is AT or BEFORE the frontier (the first NOT-DONE Main node). Sub-nodes of the frontier step
are fine (e.g. step8_foo.lean when step8 is frontier). Files that don't match the step pattern
(fp.lean, Main.lean, etc.) are always allowed.

Determining the frontier:
  - Frontier = the first Main node that is NOT `done` on the status board — which means STALE
    (certified, but an input file changed) counts as not-done just like uncertified `todo`. A
    certified-but-stale node therefore HARD-STOPS work on every later step until it's re-certified
    (`check_step <prop> --subtree <node>`). This is the whole point: an agent must not skip ahead
    past a node whose proof no longer holds.
  - Computed by delegating to `faithful_lib.status_rows` (the same authoritative, build-free board
    `check_step --status` renders — pure source-parse + file-hash, no Lean/SMT) so the hook's notion
    of "done" can never drift from the board.
  - FALLBACK (if faithful_lib can't be imported / status_rows raises): a presence-only frontier —
    first Main node not in the manifest's `subtrees` keys, via a local regex parse. Fail-open: the
    hook must never crash the Write/Edit pipeline.
  - A fresh prop (no manifest, or no `subtrees` yet) allows everything — don't block step1.
