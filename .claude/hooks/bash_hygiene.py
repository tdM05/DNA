"""PreToolUse(Bash) hygiene gate for the DNA / LeanEuclidPlus repo.

WHY: CLAUDE.md reserves Bash for read-only git + the `scripts/check_*` / `wire_main` pipeline +
a few path helpers, and says "read files with Read, search with Grep/Glob — never shell out to
cat/head/tail/sed/awk/find/jq/python3 -c". But a *denylist in prose* can't be enforced: an agent
pattern-matches the named commands and invents an unnamed sibling (`python3 -c`, `jq`, `awk`, or a
git SUBcommand like `git grep` that isn't a leading `grep` token at all), which isn't allowlisted
either, so it falls through this hook AND has no settings.json allow match, popping a normal
permission prompt for what should've been silently gated. This hook is a POSITIVE allowlist gate,
not a denylist of named-bad commands: every sub-command is checked against the known-good shapes
(read-only git, the pipeline scripts, the path helpers) and anything that doesn't match — including
unnamed siblings and git/lake subcommands outside the allowed set — is gated the same way as the
explicitly-named inspection binaries.

The gate's reaction to an off-allowlist command is set by `hygiene.conf` (read fresh every run, so an
edit takes effect on the very next command):
  mode = ask    -> pause and PROMPT the user to approve/reject it          (default; "go through me")
  mode = deny   -> hard-block it silently, naming the right tool            ("don't bug me")
This is the "sometimes block, sometimes let me decide" knob: flip one word in hygiene.conf. ("just run
everything" is not a mode here — that's settings.json's Bash() allowlist, not this hygiene gate.)

Applies to the main agent AND every subagent (PreToolUse fires for all Bash tool calls).

Contract: read the PreToolUse JSON on stdin; on an off-allowlist command print the configured
decision (ask/deny) and exit 0, or nothing for allow; otherwise print nothing and exit 0 (never
block the pipeline by erroring)."""
