System E proofs are checked by an SMT backend behind `euclid_finish` / `euclid_assert` /
`euclid_apply`. The hard truth that governs everything below:

> **`euclid_finish` is a fast *checker of small explicit steps*, NOT an oracle that finds proofs.**
> When it is handed a large context or a goal that needs a non-obvious chain, it does not "think
> harder" — it searches, stalls, and times out. **You are the prover. The solver only checks.**

Every rule here is a corollary of that inversion. This methodology was derived the hard way
(Prop 45/47/48); following it from the start turns a multi-hour thrash into steady, fast progress.

(There is no single fully-vetted reference proof to copy yet — earlier Book-2 props are still being
brought up to the current pipeline. Do NOT imitate a specific prop's files; follow the structure THIS
skill describes: the STAGE-A decomposition comment block + per-sentence `euclid_sentence` `have`s. This
skill is the **how** — how to produce that structure and discharge each step without thrashing.
In particular, the Prop01–04 off-line / sameSide / right-angle LEAVES are the ⟨OLD HAND-BUILT FORM⟩ of the
plumbing — NO LONGER the model for those facts: today you discharge them with a one-line `Helpers/`
library call (see the PARALLEL-RECTANGLE CHAINS section + the `euclid-figures` skill). Cite them for
STRUCTURE only, never to copy a hand-built chain a lemma now covers.)

## ENVIRONMENT

- **Work from the `LeanEuclidPlus/` directory** (`<repo>/LeanEuclidPlus/`). All `scripts/...` paths
  and `lake` targets below are relative to it. `Book/` = Book 1, `Book2/` = Book 2.
- **`euclid_finish` shells out to the SMT solvers `z3` and `cvc5` by bare name** — they live only in
  the project venv `~/.venvs/leaneuclid/bin`. `check_step.py` puts that venv bin on PATH itself, so
  builds find z3/cvc5 with no `source` needed. (You never invoke `lake`/`safe_build` directly — they're
  hard-denied; `check_step` is your only build path.)
- **Build ONLY via `python3 scripts/check_step.py <propdir> --provable <node>`** (or the no-flag
  `<node>` for SF→SP→P). It holds the build lock (parallel-agent safe), wall-caps at 30s, and reads the
  output for you. Do NOT pipe it (`| grep`/`| head`) — run it bare and read what it prints.
- Lean/`lake` themselves are elan-managed (`leanprover/lean4:v4.8.0-rc2` per `lean-toolchain`), on PATH.
- **Faithfulness check** `scripts/check_faithful.py "Book2/PropNN.lean"` is pure Python 3 stdlib —
  no venv. The book-aware variant `scripts/check_faithful.sh Book2` needs a built `.olean` first.
- The venv `~/.venvs/leaneuclid` also serves the autoformalization pipeline
  (`AutoFormalization/`); activate it explicitly only when running that pipeline tooling.

## NEVER FAKE IT (integrity — read first)

A green build that hides a hole is **worse than an honest failure**, because the human trusts "it
builds." These are absolute:

- **Never leave `sorry`, `admit`, `sorryAx`, or `native_decide` in a finished proof, and never
  declare a hard fact as an `axiom` to make the build pass.** A build prints "Build completed
  successfully" *even with `sorry` warnings* — so "it builds" is NOT proof. `check_step --provable`
  reports remaining sorries explicitly (file:lines), and `--all` FAILS on any sorry. **Success = zero
  sorry, zero
  errors.** Report honestly: if a `sorry` remains, the step is NOT done — say so.
- **Never alter a proposition's STATEMENT** (its `theorem proposition_N : ∀ … → …` signature) to
  make it provable. The statement is ground truth (and is statement-faithfulness-checked). Weakening
  a hypothesis or the goal is a silent correctness/faithfulness break. Only the **proof body** and
  **helper lemmas** may change. (Helper lemmas you create may take tailored hypotheses — that's fine;
  the *proposition's own* signature is sacred.)
- **Derive, don't axiomatize.** If a needed fact follows from existing axioms / earlier propositions,
  DERIVE it (that is the whole job — see the pattern gallery). The bar for interrupting the human is
  high: stop and ask **only** if (a) you become convinced the goal/sub-fact is actually FALSE, or
  (b) you are convinced a genuinely NEW axiom (not in `SystemE/Theory/`) is required. Do not ask the
  human just because a step is hard — hard-but-derivable is the normal case; do the derivation.
- **Touch only the proposition the human assigned you.** If a *different* prop is broken, REPORT it;
  do not "helpfully" fix it (another agent may own it).

## THE NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

Violating any of these is what causes the thrash. They are hard constraints, not suggestions.

0. **STRUCTURE FIRST — never one-shot the proof.** Do NOT write the whole proof and run it to "see
   if it works." A failing all-in-one `euclid_finish` teaches you almost nothing and burns a build.
   Before any proof tactic: decompose the Euclid argument into a justified step-structure (Phase 1
   below — the format is described there, not copied from a specific prop), stub each step with
   `sorry`, confirm the SKELETON elaborates, and only THEN discharge leaves one at a time (Phase 2 =
   THE LOOP). The shape of the work is always: **decompose → justify → stub → confirm skeleton →
   fill leaves**, never "attempt → fail → patch."

1. **Never run a tactic you cannot justify.** Before any `euclid_finish`/`euclid_apply`, you must
   be able to say *why* it closes (which axioms, which facts). If your reason is "let's see" or
   "I believe it should" — STOP. "I believe" = "not verified" = not done.

2. **Never run something you predict will fail or be slow.** If you suspect a step won't close,
   that suspicion is information: act on it (decompose / find the right axiom) instead of running it.

3. **The 30-second rule.** If a single `euclid_finish` takes more than ~30s, it is too big.
   Do NOT wait it out or retry verbatim. Decompose into smaller `have`s. Speed is the signal:
   a correct atomic step is fast; a slow step means you are asking the solver to search.

4. **One lemma per file; prove one at a time.** Never bundle multiple unproven helpers into one
   file "to test together." Smallest verifiable unit, isolated, built on its own.

5. **Reason before building. Builds confirm; they never substitute for thinking.** A full Prop
   build can be minutes (Prop47 ≈ 10 min). Never build "to see what happens." Build only to
   *confirm* something you already have strong reason to believe. Cheap isolated helper builds
   (`import SystemE` only, ~30s) are fine and encouraged as confirmation.

6. **Decompose only into ENTAILED sub-facts.** A `have hX : P := by ...` is a bug, not progress,
   if `P` is not actually forced by the current hypotheses. The classic trap: splitting a true
   goal into a sub-fact that is only *sometimes* true (e.g. holds when an angle is acute, but the
   context doesn't pin acuteness). Such a `have` can never close and wastes every cycle. Before
   introducing a sub-fact, confirm the context entails it.

7. **Verify TRUTH on a concrete model before proving.** When a fact's truth is in doubt, assign
   coordinates that satisfy THIS proposition's hypotheses and check numerically. Pick the model to
   fit the prop — a right-triangle prop might use a=(0,0), b=(0,3), c=(4,0); a general-triangle prop
   needs a generic (non-right, non-isoceles) triangle so you don't accidentally rely on a special
   case. A statement can be true yet your *decomposition* of it false — distinguish these.

8. **Replace SMT search with explicit axiom application.** The single most effective move. Instead
   of hoping `euclid_finish` finds the chain, apply the axioms yourself with `euclid_apply`, so the
   solver has nothing to search. (See the pattern gallery.)

9. **Check axioms and context YOURSELF.** Read the axiom signature; map each of its preconditions
   to a named fact in the goal state. Do not ask the human to read the info view for something you
   can derive, and do not guess argument order — look it up.

---

## PHASE 1 — STRUCTURE FIRST (do this before ANY proof tactic)

This is how every proof BEGINS — whether formalizing a new proposition or repairing one. It is the
discipline that prevents the wasteful "write it all, run it, watch it fail" start.

```
1. READ THE SOURCE. The Euclid proof text (Book 1: `Book/texts_proofs/{prop}.txt`; Book 2:
   `Book2/data/texts_proofs/{prop}.txt`). Understand the mathematical argument before formalizing.

2. DECOMPOSE (STAGE-A). Write the numbered step-structure as a comment block: each step has
   objects / hypotheses / WTS (what-to-show) / reasoning / DEPENDS-on-which-earlier-steps. This is where
   you JUSTIFY the structure — each step must follow
   from its named dependencies. If a step doesn't follow, the decomposition is wrong; fix it here,
   on paper, where it is cheap — NOT later by patching tactics.

3. STUB AS A SKELETON. Encode each step as a `have`/`euclid_sentence` (Book 2: use the faithfulness
   annotations per Book2/WORKFLOW.md) with `:= by sorry`. Constructions become `euclid_apply ... as x`.
   The conclusion chains the step results.

4. CONFIRM THE SKELETON ELABORATES. Build with the `sorry`s in place. This checks the STRUCTURE is
   type-correct (every step's statement is well-formed, dependencies are in scope) before you spend
   any effort proving leaves. A skeleton that elaborates = a correct plan; now the work is only to
   fill `sorry`s — and filling a `sorry` can never invalidate the structure.
```

A `sorry`-stubbed skeleton that builds is REAL, durable progress. One-shotting is not. Only after
the skeleton elaborates do you enter Phase 2 to discharge each leaf.

## PHASE 2 — THE LOOP (discharge one `sorry` / failing step at a time)

```
1. GET THE GOAL STATE. You can't see the info-view — use `python3 scripts/check_step.py <propdir>
   --context <node>` (the script inserts trace_state, builds, prints the real hypotheses, reverts).
   You need: the exact goal, and every named hypothesis available at that node.

2. ISOLATE THE ONE FAILING GOAL. A timeout at the end of a long proof is almost always
   "huge context", not "hard logic". Identify the single conjunct/assert that fails.

2.5. SMELL IT BEFORE DECOMPOSING (optional, cheap). Before investing a whole sub-lemma+backing-file
   subtree, run `python3 scripts/check_step.py <propdir> --smell <node>` — it fires the BARE claim at
   `euclid_finish` under a short solver cap. If it says **CLOSES**, DON'T decompose: the goal closes
   directly, so just let it close (a leaf whose body is `euclid_finish`, or a smaller context — you were
   about to over-decompose). If **NOT CLOSED**, proceed to step 3 (the normal path). If **SAT**, the
   claim is FALSE — fix the statement, don't decompose. (This is a sanity gate, not a substitute for
   reasoning out WHY the claim is true — you should already know that from step 1.)

3. TRIM TO A SUB-LEMMA — as a `have` NODE + its backing file. Add `have F : <failing goal> := by
   sorry` where it's needed, and create the backing file `<propdir>/F.lean` (`import SystemE` + only
   the PropMM it cites — NEVER a helper/step import; `set_option systemE.solverTime 30 in`; theorem
   `helper_<book>_F` whose hyps are ONLY the ~10 facts relevant to it, from step 1). Smaller context =
   no search blowup. Run SF (`check_step <propdir> --sufficient F`) to confirm the claim closes the
   parent, then SP (`--suppliable F`) to confirm its hyps are present.

4. TRACE THE PROOF BY HAND. Decide the axiom chain. For each `euclid_apply (axiom args)`:
     - find/read the axiom's signature with `python3 scripts/find.py` (the sanctioned smart-grep over
       the declaration DB — e.g. `--concludes between` for "what gives me a betweenness", `--mentions
       sameSide --kind axiom` to see every axiom touching `sameSide`, `--name "pasch_*"` for a family,
       `--consumes formParallelogram` for "what can I do with a parallelogram I have"); then `Read` the
       cited `source` line for the exact arg order. (Do NOT shell out to `grep` — it's hook-blocked.)
     - map every argument and every PRECONDITION to a fact you have,
     - if a precondition isn't present, that's your next sub-goal (recurse: another `have`+backing file).
   Prefer explicit axiom applications over `euclid_finish` for anything non-trivial.

5. PROVE + BUILD THE BACKING FILE (cheap, ~30s): `python3 scripts/check_step.py <propdir>
   --provable F`. If it's slow (>30s) or fails: it's too big or not entailed — go to 4 and decompose
   into more `have`+backing files. NEVER raise the cap.

6. SUPPLIABILITY is already covered by SP (step 3) — the SCRIPT wires the node + its import
   transiently; you NEVER hand-write `euclid_apply (helper…)` or an import. If SP failed, a hypothesis
   isn't available at the call site: narrow the signature to context-present facts, or hoist the
   missing one to an earlier `have`+backing file — don't just move the problem.

7. CONFIRM the node with the no-flag `check_step <propdir> F` (SF→SP→P). A build "completes" even with
   `sorry` warnings, so that's NOT proof — `--provable` reports any remaining sorry file:lines, and the
   final `--all` FAILS on any sorry. Zero sorry + suppliable = node done.
```

## CRUCIAL SUBTLETIES (learned painfully — don't relearn them)

### Construction data is NOT re-derivable from a trimmed context
Facts like `d.sameSide c AB` (which side of a line a constructed point lands on) come from the
*construction* (e.g. `proposition_46'` building a square on a chosen side). They are NOT logically
entailed by incidence + distinctness alone. If your helper needs such a fact:
  - first check if the Prop **already has it named** in context (it often does — pass it in as a
    helper hypothesis, and it discharges trivially at the call site); 
  - if the Prop does NOT have it named, you must DERIVE it (it is not free), or realize your
    decomposition is wrong.

### `euclid_apply` adds the CONCLUSION, not the preconditions
When you `euclid_apply (some_axiom ...)`, the solver discharges the axiom's antecedent and adds
its **conclusion** to context. The antecedent conjuncts are proved transiently and are **NOT**
left as hypotheses. So you cannot rely on "prop29 used `f.opposingSides l GH` at line 32, therefore
it's in context at line 38" — it is not. If you need it later, derive/assert it where needed.

### Circularity in angle/side reasoning
`sum_angles_onlyif` produces an angle-sum equation FROM two `sameSide` facts; `sum_angles_if`
produces the `sameSide` facts FROM the angle-sum. So proving a `sameSide` via an angle-split that
itself needs that `sameSide` is circular. Break circularity with a *different* primitive —
typically **betweenness → sameSide via `pasch_2`/`pasch_4`** (which don't go through angles).

### A discharged precondition of an earlier `euclid_apply` is a real, true fact
If `proposition_31 a b d BD` was applied successfully, its precondition `¬a.onLine BD` was true
there. That tells you the fact is PROVABLE (good for designing a derivation) — but per the rule
above it is not necessarily still *in context*. Re-derive it explicitly if a later step needs it.

---

## PATTERN GALLERY (reusable explicit-axiom chains)

These are the moves that replaced `euclid_finish`-and-hope. Look up exact sigs with
`python3 scripts/find.py` (the smart-grep — `--mentions <sym>`, `--concludes <sym>`, `--name "<glob>"`),
then `Read` the `source` line; the axioms live in
`SystemE/Theory/Inferences/{Diagrammatic,Transfer,Metric}.lean`.

- **Point on opposite sides of a line ⟹ betweenness.** `pasch_4 a b c L M`: `L≠M`, `b∈L∩M`,
  `a,c` distinct on `M`, `¬a.sameSide c L` ⟹ `between a b c`. Use to prove a transversal foot
  lands between two points. (Prop47 `between b l' c`; Prop45 glue points.)

- **Betweenness ⟹ the two sameSide facts ⟹ angle split.** `pasch_2` turns `between p x q` into
  `x.sameSide ... `; then `sum_angles_onlyif` turns those into `∠p:b:q = ∠p:b:x + ∠x:b:q`.
  This is the NON-circular way to split an angle at an external point. (Prop47 perpendicular lemma.)

- **Three lines through one point — side transfer.** `triple_incidence_2 L M N a b c d`: from one
  `sameSide` + one `¬sameSide` across the three concurrent lines, derive a third `sameSide`.
  (Prop47 `f.sameSide a BC` from `a.sameSide c BF`.)

- **Parallel ⟹ same side / off-line.** ⟨LIBRARY FIRST⟩ For Book-2 figures these are now importable
  lemmas in `Helpers/{OffLine,SameSide}.lean` — `offLine_of_parallel(_simple)(')`,
  `sameSide_of_parallel('/_both)` — so the fact is ONE `euclid_apply` (hyps by `assumption`), NOT a
  hand-built leaf; see the `euclid-figures` Family 1/3 boxes for which lemma matches your atoms. The
  underlying axioms (the FALLBACK when no sibling fits): `intersection_lines_opposing` (contrapositive):
  points on a line that does NOT cross `L` are on the same side of `L`. `intersection_lines_common_point`:
  a point on two distinct lines ⟹ they intersect (use by_contra to prove a point is off a parallel).
  (Prop45 `l.sameSide m GH`.)

- **Parallels + transversal ⟹ equal/right angle.** `proposition_29'''` (alternate angles): for
  `AL ∥ BD` cut by transversal, `∠a:l':b = ∠l':b:d`; combine with a known right angle to get
  AL ⊥ transversal. (Prop47 `helper_47_AL_perp_BC`.)

- **Area decomposition of a glued parallelogram.** `sum_parallelograms_area a b c d e f ...`:
  with `e` between `a,b` and `f` between `c,d`, the four sub-triangles sum to the two halves.
  One apply + linear arithmetic closes area-sum goals. (Prop45 `helper_45_area_sum`.)

- **Split-and-delegate for CONJUNCTIVE goals (assembly steps only).** For a multi-conjunct goal
  (`formParallelogram`, `formTriangle`, a `rectangle_area` precondition):
  ```lean
  unfold formParallelogram      -- or the relevant abbrev
  repeat' constructor           -- split into conjuncts
  all_goals try (first | assumption | euclid_finish)
  ```
  closes every cheap conjunct (incidences via `assumption`, the easy ones via `euclid_finish`) in one
  sweep, leaving ONLY the genuinely-hard conjunct(s) open — which `try` surfaces by name so you see
  exactly what still needs a `have`. Good for narrowing a 10-part assembly to its 1 hard part.
  (Ref: `Book2/Prop05/step8.lean` `step8_alpar` — ⟨OLD HAND FORM: that file hand-builds the off-line /
  sameSide glue inline; the model now is to discharge those sub-facts with `Helpers/` library calls,
  leaving only the genuine assembly conjunct⟩.)
  **SCOPE — this does NOT help atomic goals.** On `¬p.onLine L` / `between p q r` (no conjunction to
  split), `repeat' constructor` is a no-op and the macro collapses to a bare `euclid_finish` that
  SEARCHES THE WHOLE FIGURE AND TIMES OUT. Those atomic off-line/betweenness facts still need the
  explicit anchored chain (`have hLneM : L ≠ M := …; euclid_apply (intersection_lines_common_point …)`)
  — see the parallel/off-line entry above. Use split-and-delegate for assembly; use explicit anchors
  for the atomic plumbing. (Empirically, the atomic plumbing — not the assembly — is the real cost
  sink in Book-2 figure steps.)

### THE PARALLEL-RECTANGLE FIGURE CHAINS → see the `euclid-figures` skill
**LIBRARY FIRST.** For the off-line / sameSide / area-recast / right-angle-from-co-interior shapes there
is now an importable `Helpers/` lemma — TRY IT FIRST (one `euclid_apply`, hyps by `assumption`, NO
hand-built leaf), and PROMOTE a new recurring variant into the library rather than re-hand-building it.
The chains below are the FALLBACK for those families and the genuine method for the rest.
The recurring goal-shapes in "decompose a rectangle by internal parallels" proofs (Book 2 Props 1–8 —
the bulk of the hours on the done Prop01/02/03 + Prop04) have known axiom-chain recipes: **same-side-of-a-parallel**
(`intersection_lines_opposing`), **point-off-a-line** / **line-distinctness**, **foot/crossing
betweenness** (`pasch_3`→`pasch_4`; this is the `between b g d`/`between b k e` shape), **`formParallelogram`
assembly** (decompose, don't fat-`euclid_finish`), **`rectangle_area`/`sum_parallelograms_area`**
(extract the precondition first), and the **parallel/angle props** (`proposition_30/29/6/34`). Each is
rule #8 (explicit application) made concrete. When you hit one, consult the **`euclid-figures`** skill —
it lists goal-shape → chain → gotcha, grounded in the proven files. Build each as its own `have`+backing
sub-node; don't re-derive a chain you can look up.

> **✅ `linarith` / `nlinarith` / `ring` ARE available — Mathlib is a project dependency.** Import the
> specific tactic module at the top of the backing file (e.g. `import Mathlib.Tactic.Linarith`) and use
> them for the pure-arithmetic *tail* of a step — the linear/ring combine over ℝ (`2·x = ∟ ⟹ x = ∟/2`,
> area/length sums). The SMT translator behind `euclid_finish` chokes on exactly this arithmetic (notably
> `2 * x` in hypothesis position), so `linarith`/`ring` is often the *right* closer there, not a fallback.
> They obey the same rules as any tactic: a real justified step (rule #1), ≤30s (they're fast), correct
> node structure. Keep the GEOMETRY in the SMT path (`euclid_apply`/`euclid_finish` equalities as
> `have`s); put the ARITHMETIC in Mathlib. Canonical shape: `euclid_apply angle_symm …` then `linarith`
> for the halving (ref `Book2/Prop09/step10.lean`). Full detail in `euclid-figures`.

- **Right-triangle / Pythagoras length algebra.** Pure `|·|` equations: substitute and use
  `s² = t², s,t ≥ 0 ⟹ s = t` (the solver knows `segment_gte_zero`). No geometry needed — strip
  the helper to just the length equations. (Prop48 `helper_48_dc_eq_bc`.)

- **Acute/obtuse case splits.** `between_points` gives the 3 orderings of collinear points;
  rule out the bad ones with `proposition_13` (straight-line supplement = 2∟) + `proposition_17`
  (triangle angle bound) + an acuteness fact. `euclid_finish` will NOT do this case-split for you.
  (Prop47 `helper_47_between_blc`.)

---

## SMT TIME CAP — fail fast, don't burn the default 300s

`euclid_finish` gives each solver a **default of 300 seconds** (`systemE.solverTime`). That is why a
single bad/too-big step can hang for minutes before failing — the opposite of the 30-second rule.

**While developing a helper, cap it to 30s so over-large steps fail fast** instead of stalling. Put
this immediately above the theorem (it applies to the next declaration):

```lean
set_option systemE.solverTime 30 in
theorem helper_NN_<name> : ... := by
  ...
```

A step that can't close in 30s is telling you it's too big or not entailed — decompose it (Phase 2),
don't raise the cap to wait it out. Do NOT use a shell `timeout` around the build for this — the cap
belongs in the file, where it actually bounds each solver call.

Once the helper is proven: a well-decomposed step closes in well under 30s, so the cap usually just
stays (harmless). Only if a *legitimate, irreducible* step genuinely needs more should you raise or
remove the cap — and then say so, because a committed proof relying on a near-300s solve is fragile.
Never raise the cap merely to make a thrashing step pass.

## BUILDING — always go through `check_step.py`

**Build ONLY with `python3 scripts/check_step.py <propdir> <node>` (SF→SP→P) or `--provable <node>`
(just the build).** Raw `lake build` / `safe_build.sh` are hard-denied to the agent. `check_step` holds
an exclusive `flock` (so concurrent agents can't corrupt `.lake/build/` + Lake's trace DB), puts
z3/cvc5 on PATH, wall-caps each build at 30s, and prints the result (zero-sorry, or the sorry
file:lines). This is a correctness requirement, not a convenience.

```bash
python3 scripts/check_step.py Book2/PropNN <node>             # SF → SP → P (the everyday command)
python3 scripts/check_step.py Book2/PropNN --provable <node>  # just build that node's backing file
python3 scripts/check_step.py Book2/PropNN --provable         # (no node) build Main, tolerate sorry
```

A node's backing file is cheap (~30s); if it won't build in 30s it's TOO BIG → decompose into more
`have`+backing files (the recursive rule). Never explore by building; build to confirm a step.

## WORKING ALONGSIDE OTHER AGENTS

- **Other agents may be editing other Prop/Helper files in this repo at the same time.** Touch only
  the files for YOUR assigned proposition (its `PropNN.lean` and the `HelperNN_*.lean` you create).
  Do not edit another proposition's files or another agent's helpers.
- **Do not run `git` mutations** (`add`, `commit`, `push`, `restore`, `checkout`, `stash`). The human
  owns git. The last commit is the human's safety net — they can revert anything you change — which
  is exactly why git stays in their hands. Read-only git (`status`, `diff`, `log`) is fine.
- You MAY freely create/edit files under `Book/` and `Book2/` (permission is granted) — the git
  safety net makes that safe. Just stay within your proposition's files.

## HELPER FILE CONVENTIONS

- Name `Book/HelperNN_<short_name>.lean`; theorem `helper_NN_<short_name>`; `namespace Elements.Book1`
  (or `Book2`). Doc comment: which Prop line it serves, the NL geometry, and the proof strategy.
- Import only what's needed (`SystemE` + specific `Book.PropMM`). Keeps builds fast.
- Hypotheses = exactly the facts the proof uses, copied from the goal-state dump. No more, no less.
- Always put `set_option systemE.solverTime 30 in` above the theorem (the dev cap — `--check` requires
  exactly 30; `wire_main` strips it at Phase C).
- You NEVER wire the helper into its parent or add its import — the SCRIPT does both, transiently
  (SP) and permanently (Phase C `wire_main`). You only write the backing file's proof body.
- **Faithfulness pipeline (per `faithful-prove`):** when a helper realizes ONE Euclid sentence, it
  lives in the prop's folder as `Book<N>/PropNN/stepN.lean`, theorem `helper_<book>_<prop>_stepN`
  (sub-decompositions `Book<N>/PropNN/stepN_<sub>.lean` → `helper_<book>_<prop>_stepN_<sub>`); build/verify
  each via `python3 scripts/check_step.py Book<N>/PropNN stepN`. The script discharges the sentence in
  `Main.lean` by `euclid_apply (helper_<book>_<prop>_stepN … (by assumption)…); (try split_ands) <;> assumption`
  — a zero-SMT structural wire, NOT `euclid_finish` (you never type it). (No
  `Scratch/`, no `_steps.lean`, no merge step.) **Never** discharge a cited step with term-mode
  `exact proposition_M …` — a citation is only recorded when the prop/helper enters via `euclid_apply`.

## RESUMING / THE CHECKLIST — `--status` + the in-order discipline

- **Drive Main's nodes 1..N in order; once a Main node shows `✓` it's DONE — never revisit it**, except
  by working inside its own cone (which immediately flips it back via the hash check, so you can't
  silently regress it without `--status` noticing). This mirrors `faithful-prove`'s "go through Main's
  sentences IN ORDER" rule — later steps lean on earlier ones as hypotheses, so an out-of-order pass
  proves against an unstable context.
- **Picking a prop back up (yours or another agent's)?** Run `python3 scripts/check_step.py <propdir>
  --status` first — instant, read-only, no build. It shows every Main node as `done`/`stale`/`todo`
  against the certification manifest, plus the exact next `--subtree` command, so you don't have to
  reconstruct progress from memory or re-run a slow audit. Then run `--drive` to actually close that
  list instead of running each printed `--subtree` yourself: it loops over the not-`done` nodes in
  order, stopping at the first real failure (including a leaf that's still bare `sorry` — fix it, then
  re-run `--drive`). Works the same whether the prop has never been audited (manifest empty, every
  node starts `todo`) or is partway done (it skips the already-`✓` nodes).
- **Leave breadcrumbs.** `Book<N>/PropNN/agent_notes.md` (per-prop, freeform) and the repo-root
  `AGENT_NOTES.md` (cross-cutting) are scratchpads — never parsed, never enforced — for things the NEXT
  agent on this prop should know: a dead end you ruled out, why a node got split a particular way, a
  tooling quirk. Check them when resuming; add to them when you find something worth keeping.

## DON'T

- Don't add a hypothesis to a helper to make it close without checking the Prop can supply it
  (you've only moved the problem — see Phase 2 step 6).
- Don't change PropNN's overall proof structure to patch one step — extract a helper instead.
- Don't report "done / it builds" while a `sorry` remains (see NEVER FAKE IT).

**Note for the human committer (not the agent — agents don't run git):** when committing Book work,
`git add Book/` alone is insufficient. Book depends on `SystemE/` (the faithfulness tactics:
`Faithful.lean` + changes to `Solve.lean`/`Util.lean`/`Tactics.lean`) and on the `Book.lean` /
`Book2.lean` aggregator import lists. Stage those too, or the build breaks for everyone else.
